# vim-projections

## Description

Vim-projections is a configuration file repository for projection configuration
files used by different frameworks and languages.  It was created as a way to
have a sane default when starting a new project without having to create your
own or find the location of the last projections file you had in a different
project.

## Contributions

You are free to make pull requests adding new projections.  I ask that these
be what would be considered default behavior in the framework/language.  As an
example, I'd like to see a framework that stores its source files in /src and
tests in /tests to have a mapping that reflects this.

Modifications are also allowed, however, since I am not experienced in every
language/framework, it may be up to the collective to decide if the change
needs to happen to a file.
